inpaint
=========

Messing around trying to implement the image completion algorithm in _Kaiming He and Jian Sun_, [Statistics of Patch Offsets for Image Completion](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/kahe/eccv12/index.html).  

Previous work that almost worked is primarily in the pyinpaint.ipynb ipython notebook and relies on  [gco_python](https://github.com/bachase/gco_python) with my added ``cut_inpaint`` method.

Switching to julia and making another pass.
