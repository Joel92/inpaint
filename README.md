pyinpaint
=========

Messing around trying to implement the image completion algorithm in _Kaiming He and Jian Sun_, [Statistics of Patch Offsets for Image Completion](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/kahe/eccv12/index.html).  Work thus far is primarily in the pyinpaint.ipynb ipython notebook.  

Requires
--------

*Ipython notebook, numpy etc.  I recommend Anaconda distribution.
*[gco_python](https://github.com/bachase/gco_python) with my added ``cut_inpaint`` method
